**Multi Logistic Regression Project**
**Overview**
This project demonstrates the application of multi logistic regression, a statistical method used for predicting categorical outcomes based on input features. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the dependent variable has more than two categories. This repository serves as an example of implementing and evaluating multi logistic regression models.

**Features**
Illustrates the process of training and evaluating multi logistic regression models.
Provides insights into how to preprocess data for classification tasks.
Demonstrates the interpretation of model outputs and evaluation metrics.
Usage
This repository does not contain specific code implementations but serves as a conceptual guide for understanding and applying multi logistic regression techniques. Users can refer to external resources or implement their own versions based on the outlined principles.

**Contributing**
Contributions to enhance the documentation or provide additional insights into multi logistic regression are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
